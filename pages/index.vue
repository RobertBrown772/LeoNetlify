        Hi there, Iâ€™m Leo Tetley, an aspiring Digital/Graphic/UX Designer with ambitions to develop my creative skills in my academic studies and future aspirations to build a career in the design or media fields. My biggest passions in life are art and creative design. I like anything surreal or unique and disruptive. 
      </p>
      <p class="lead mt-3">
        I hold a natural aptitude for technology and have explored tools such as HTML, Photoshop, Python and CAD. 
        I also enjoy skateboarding, socialising with friends and playing guitar. I am an avid social gamer and an active user of Twitch. I would like to explore more Social Media platforms and their capabilities in my studies, as well as building an understanding of the business concepts involved in Marketing and Design.
