This sketch was made while while I was at school in my free time when I had nothing else to do. I used a HB pencil, ruler and eraser for this sketch. For the blending I used my finger. (the blending being the background lead smudges). This image took about 3 hours and 30 minutes to make. Ithink it could've been better, but it was okay for one of my first major scale sketches.
