 This image made at my dads house. I used a full pencil set, a putty eraser and a referance image for this sketch (the referance image being the image of the game I was drawing). This image took about 2 hours and 30 minutes to make. I think it is one one of my best yet simplest drawings,surprisingly i did not struggle with the 3D aspect.
