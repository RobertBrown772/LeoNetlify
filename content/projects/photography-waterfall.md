For this image, the only issue I had was the fact that I was using my phone, and the image was taken in the middle of the day, so the lighting was not the best. I used the camera app on my phone, and I didn't use any editing materials or different editing apps for this image, and I think this image turned out pretty well, and I think the outcome is the best it could be for the situation.
