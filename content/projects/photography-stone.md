This image I took on a DSLR Camera in Porlock Wier, Somerset. I made the rock totem seen in the picture, and it took afew shots from different angles to get the perfect shot. The rock toteem was made from afew rocks i found around the beach. It was also saved as a RAW image, so I could edit it to my liking. I edited the image in Lightroom, and I used the exposure, saturation, blackpoint and highlights. I think this image turned out pretty well, and I am happy with the outcome.
