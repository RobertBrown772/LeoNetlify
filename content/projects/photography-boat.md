This image I took on my phone, and used alot of editing material provided by my camera app. I edited things on this image like exposure, saturation, blackpoint and higlights. I used no filters on this image and for the amount of editing material I was provided with, I think it came out a bit messy, but nevertheless, a decent image and concept.
